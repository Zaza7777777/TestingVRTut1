  title: Triggers and Object Creation
  sections:
  - heading: Triggers
    text: Triggers are objects with a Collider. Instead of a regular Collider though,
      the isTrigger flag is selected. This means that the object is no longer solid,
      objects can moves through it. When this happens the OnTriggerXXX methods are
      called with the colliding object passed in as a parameter.

  - heading: Object Creation
    text: In Unity, you create a GameObject using the Instantiate method. If you
      pass an instance of a configured GameObject, or prefab, then a copy of that
      object is made. This object can then be placed and oriented in the world.

  - heading: Tweening
    text: Simple animation (movement, rotation, scaling) can be programmed manually
      in the Update method. However, there are some existing packages, such as LeanTween,
      that allow you to set up simple animations and let them run automatically.
      You can control how the animation is "tweened", attach lambdas to specific
      events, etc.
