      will appear in the Console window. However, if you are developing and have
      deployed to a mobile device, you will not have easy access to the log.

      that creates a command console that can be opened and closed using the tilda.
      It can also have buttons to open and close (which is useful for mobile devices).
      Similar to Debug.Log, you can send mssages to Terminal.Log and these are displayed
      on the console. Additionally you can also add commands to perform actions when
      entered in the command terminal.
