  title: Raycasting
  sections:
  - heading: Raycasting
    text: Raycasting is a useful way to determine whether an object has been clicking
      on, whether AI can "see" another obect, determining the closest object in a
      certain direction, etc.

  - heading: Sensors
    text: Raycasting is often used to create sensors with which an agent can sense
      the world. This allows characters to determine what is behind, left of, right
      of, below themselves and make decisions based on this information. Typically
      these sensors will only cast their rays out to a specific distance (not infinity).
